# Azure Data Engineering End-to-End Project
This project is an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering implementation, covering the use of cutting-edge technologies like Azure Data Factory, Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake. The project focuses on building a robust data pipeline using real-world data, showcasing best practices, and providing detailed tutorials to enhance your data engineering skills.

## Project Overview
In this project, I dive into real-time scenarios with Azure Data Factory, explore Databricks in-depth, and demonstrate how to use Delta Tables for efficient data storage and management. Additionally, I cover the implementation of the Medallion Architecture for streamlined data workflows and address common interview questions in the end-to-end data engineering domain.
